## About the Project

**In Pursuit of Stolen Ghosts | Duet in Latent Space** is a creation by Marlon Barrios Solano, developed during his artistic and research residency at Lake Studios Berlin in February 2024. This project explores the intersection of generative AI, sound design, and performance within the conceptual framework of latent space â€” a high-dimensional space used by machine learning algorithms to generate and manipulate data.

This app reflects on themes of cultural loss and diaspora, particularly Marlon's personal narrative related to his Venezuelan heritage and migration. The "stolen ghost" metaphor represents the profound sense of loss for the obliterated cultural ancestors and traditions, exploring these themes through interactive and generative art.

### Composition

The application utilizes p5.js to create a real-time generative, interactive drawing of moving brown circles. These circles, animated with Perlin noise, shift in response to mouse movements, creating a dynamic and engaging visual display that symbolizes the interaction with unseen forces and memories.

### Features

- **Real-Time Generative Art**: Continuously generates brown circles using Perlin noise for a fluid, ever-changing visual experience.
- **Interactive Drawing**: The visual elements respond interactively to mouse movements, allowing users to influence the artwork in real-time.
- **Complementary Soundtrack**: Enhances the visual experience with a specifically composed soundtrack, deepening the emotional resonance of the interaction.
